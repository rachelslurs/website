# Commit Rules

## Conventional Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for all commit messages:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - A code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- `ci:` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Examples

```
feat(components): add Button component with variants

Implements a reusable Button component with primary, secondary, and outline variants.
Includes proper TypeScript types and accessibility attributes.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): handle null response in fetchFruits

Prevents runtime error when API returns null by adding proper null checks.
```

## Best Practices

- Make **small, incremental commits** for easier review and debugging
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Include scope when relevant (component name, module, etc.)
- Use body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how* (code shows how)
- Reference issues/PRs in footer when applicable
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't end the subject line with a period
