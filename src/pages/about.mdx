I am a Frontend Engineer with over 10 years of experience. My passion lies in bridging the gap between design and development; My greatest joy comes from collaborating closely with designers and product to translate their visions into delightful user experiences that everyone can enjoy.

I’ve worked at startups, on political campaigns, and at tech consultancies, contributing to projects ranging from award-winning interactive museum exhibits to B2B and B2C SaaS companies.

I have advanced expertise in React, TypeScript, CSS, and a wide range of frontend frameworks. I enjoy using design tools like Figma for collaboration, ensuring that what gets deployed honors the designer’s vision without compromise.

As both a creative and analytical thinker, I always consider the user’s perspective in every decision, whether I’m solving complex technical challenges or refining the smallest UI elements.

If you’re looking for a Frontend Engineer with a remarkable ability to work in lock-step with designers and product teams, <LinkButton href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelcantor/">I would love to hear from you!</LinkButton>
