I'm a Software Engineer with 14+ years of experience building web, mobile, and cross-platform TV applications across startups, political campaigns, and civic technology.

I was an early employee (#2) at Hype, scaling the company from pre-seed through Series A and acquisition. I'm currently founder of RecipeCast, a Micro-SaaS enabling users to cast recipes to TVs and smart displays.

My expertise spans React, TypeScript, React Native, and accessibility compliance (Section 508 Trusted Tester certified). I've built award-winning interactive museum exhibits, high-traffic campaign tools, and B2B/B2C SaaS platforms.

I love bridging design and development—working closely with designers and product teams to translate vision into delightful, accessible user experiences that everyone can enjoy.

This site is a modified version of [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). It uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) for components, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, and Markdown for blog/work content. It relies on the framework [Astro](https://astro.build) and uses [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io) for search. CMS is [Tina](https://tina.io).
