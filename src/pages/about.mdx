I'm a Software Engineer with 13+ years of experience building web, mobile, and cross-platform TV applications across startups, political campaigns, and civic technology.

I was an early employee (#2) at Hype, scaling the company from pre-seed through Series A and acquisition. I'm currently founder of RecipeCast, a Micro-SaaS enabling users to cast recipes to TVs and smart displays.

My expertise spans React, TypeScript, React Native, and accessibility compliance (Section 508 Trusted Tester certified). I've built award-winning interactive museum exhibits, high-traffic campaign tools, and B2B/B2C SaaS platforms.

I love bridging design and development—working closely with designers and product teams to translate vision into delightful, accessible user experiences that everyone can enjoy.
