import Toast from "@components/demo/Toast";

1. Uses a single source of truth (using a Ref Map) to track all active timers. This allows for global cleanup and precise control over each toast’s lifecycle.
2. Only render the max number of toasts; any extras are held in a background queue and "popped" into view only as space opens up.
3. If an identical message is triggered within a 3-second window, the system resets the existing timer instead of spawning a new toast if deduplication is enabled.
4. The logic accounts for the EXIT_ANIMATION_DURATION, ensuring the component stays in the DOM just long enough for a smooth Framer Motion fade-out.
5. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`
