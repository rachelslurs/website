import AddDeleteItems from "@components/demo/AddDeleteItems";

<AddDeleteItems client:load />


- Items appear in the UI immediately when added, before server confirmation completes.
- Each item shows its sync state: "Syncing..." with spinner while pending, "Synced!" with checkmark for 2 seconds after confirmation, then no indicator once fully synced.
- Delete operations remove items from the UI instantly with an exit animation via AnimatePresence.
- Uses Date.now() for unique IDs to avoid collisions when rapidly adding multiple items.

<ReorderableListOptimistic client:load />

- Updates the UI immediately when the user reorders without waiting for server confirmation.
- Tracks sync state per item with three visual states: syncing (spinner), just synced (checkmark for 2 seconds), and confirmed (no indicator).
- Uses Framer Motion's AnimatePresence for smooth enter/exit animations when items are added or removed.
- For reorderable lists, shows a single sync indicator at the bottom rather than per-item to avoid visual clutter.
- Clears the "Synced!" confirmation message after 2 seconds to prevent stale success indicators from cluttering the UI.
