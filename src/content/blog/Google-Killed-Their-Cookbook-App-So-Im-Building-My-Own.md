A few years ago, I was excited to get a Google Nest Hub after reading [a Wirecutter article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/cooking-with-google-nest-hub-max/) about how perfect it was for following recipes while cooking. Finally, a solution to my phone screen constantly locking while my hands were covered in [a delicious cookie dough recipe Eric Kim has me hooked on](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023675-gochujang-caramel-cookies).

Then‚Äî [Google discontinued the cookbook feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bkccrh/cookbook_no_longer_available_on_google_hub/). Just like that, my smart display became an overpriced timer.

I have a NYT Cooking subscription, but every time I want to look up a recipe on a different browser or device, I have to prove who I am all over again. On my Nest Hub, it‚Äôs even worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe browser doesn‚Äôt have my saved passwords synced.

So I started building Recipe Cast. The idea is simple: cast any recipe to your TV or Nest Hub from your phone and control it with your voice while you cook.

I made an interactive demo at [recipecast.app](https://recipecast.app) that shows how it works. I‚Äôd love to gauge interest and see if this frustration is as worthy of solving as I think it is. üôè
