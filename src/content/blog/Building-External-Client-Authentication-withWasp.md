### About the Author

I’m Rachel Cantor, a fullstack engineer with over 13 years of experience building production systems that scale.

I am beginning to take on new consulting clients for any number of projects—authentication systems, component libraries, internal tooling, or technical architecture that requires someone with a knack for detail, who can both design a system, ship production code, and make it all look great.

If you’re dealing with:

* Design systems or component libraries that need to scale
* Chrome extensions or cross-platform integrations
* Internal tools your team hasn’t had bandwidth to build properly

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://linkedin.com/in/rachelcantor) while I work on making a proper intake form. 🙌
