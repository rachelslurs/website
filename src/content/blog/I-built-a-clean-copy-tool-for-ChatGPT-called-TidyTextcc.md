### I built a clean copy tool for ChatGPT called TidyText.cc

After working with ChatGPT and other AI tools, I realized that copying and pasting responses into Google Docs often messed up the formatting. Markdown is great for structured content, but dealing with the formatting cleanup? Not so much. ðŸ˜…

### Features

1. You can paste any text from ChatGPT (or elsewhere).
2. It instantly converts the content into HTML thatâ€™s compatible with Google Docs.
3. It provides a clean preview and lets you copy the result directly to your clipboard with one click.

I built it using React, Vite, Web Workers (to handle processing of the markdown in the background), and DOMPurify for sanitizing input. I used TailwindCSS for the styling and everything is using TypeScript. Itâ€™s hosted using Cloudflare Pages.

### ðŸ”§ Why buildÂ this?

* I saw a simple problem I could solve for myself and make it simple and delightful.
* I love a good mini app as a way of trying out something new (like Vite) and brushing up on my Web Workers skills.
* Also I want to get more contracting clients.

### ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™sÂ next?

Thereâ€™s Google Docs integration coming soon, so youâ€™ll be able to generate and open documents directly in Google Docs without the extra step of copying.

If youâ€™re using ChatGPT or any AI tool and need to quickly format content for Google Docs, [TidyText](https://tidytext.cc) is the tool for you! ðŸ¤– ðŸŽ‰
