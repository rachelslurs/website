## Summary

Build an onboarding app that caters to multiple distinct user journeys while maintaining a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Client

Hype is an all-in-one marketing and payments platform for anyone using social media to grow their business. The software enables creators to build a website in minutes, earn revenue from subscriptions and tips, send message blasts to followers, and track key business analytics.

## Challenge

They wanted an app that could support any number of diverse user journeys that all began with some form of user authentication.

## Approach

The approach involved mapping out a range of flows to determine how to isolate each step, but also giving us the ability to reuse steps wherever possible. I created the user flow diagrams using Figma (Figjam).

### User flow diagrams

#### Sign up: initial registration process

#### Linking a Hype Card: Connecting an NFC card or sticker to a userâ€™s account

#### Claiming a page: User claiming ownership of a pre-existing page

## Solution

I chose to use Next.js for the application and used React to create wizards for each of the flows with the steps included. This allowed reusability wherever we needed it.

I translated designs from our product designer in Figma for each of the flows.
