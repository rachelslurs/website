This site is a modified version of [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). It uses TypeScript, ReactJS for components, TailwindCSS for styling, and Markdown for blog/work content. It relies on the framework [Astro](https://astro.build) and uses [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io) for search.
